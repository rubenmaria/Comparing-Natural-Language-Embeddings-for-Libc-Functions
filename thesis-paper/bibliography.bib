  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

abstract = {Most software systems used in production generate system logs that provide a rich source of information about the status and execution behavior of the system. These logs are commonly used to ensure the reliability and maintainability of software systems. The first step toward automated log analysis is generally log parsing, which aims to transform unstructured log messages into structured log templates and extract the corresponding parameters.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown promising results on a wide range of software engineering tasks, including log parsing. However, the extent to which non-determinism influences log parsing using LLMs remains unclear. In particular, it is important to investigate whether LLMs behave consistently when faced with the same log message multiple times.In this study, we investigate the impact of non-determinism in state-of-the-art LLMs while performing log parsing. Specifically, we select six LLMs, including both paid proprietary and free-to-use models, and evaluate their non-determinism on 16 system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects. The results of our study reveal varying degrees of non-determinism among models. Moreover, they show that there is no guarantee for deterministic results even with a temperature of zero.},

  abstract = { The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining binaries without corresponding source code. It transforms binaries into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Decompilers can reconstruct much of the information that is lost during the compilation process (e.g., structure and type information). Unfortunately, they do not reconstruct semantically meaningful variable names, which are known to increase code understandability. We propose the Decompiled Identifier Renaming Engine (DIRE), a novel probabilistic technique for variable name recovery that uses both lexical and structural information recovered by the decompiler. We also present a technique for generating corpora suitable for training and evaluating models of decompiled code renaming, which we use to create a corpus of 164,632 unique x86-64 binaries generated from C projects mined from GitHub. Our results show that on this corpus DIRE can predict variable names identical to the names in the original source code up to 74.3% of the time. },
