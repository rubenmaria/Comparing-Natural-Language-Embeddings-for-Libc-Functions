  "symlinkat": "**Purpose:**\n\nThe `open()` function allows you to open a file or device and map its file descriptor to a specified memory location.\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nImagine you have a file named \"myfile.txt\" on your computer. You want to read its contents in memory, so you use `open()` to create a file descriptor for the file and then read its contents.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `from` and `to` specify the file source and destination, respectively.\n* `fd` specifies the file descriptor to be opened.\n* If `from` is `NULL` or `to` is `NULL`, an error is set and `open()` returns -1.\n* If `fd` is not `AT_FDCWD` (which represents a file descriptor), `EBADF` is set, indicating an invalid file descriptor.\n* If `to` contains a `/` character, an error is set, indicating an invalid file path.\n* Otherwise, `ENOSYS` is set, indicating that the requested operation is not supported.\n\n**Overall functionality:**\n\n`open()` allows you to establish a connection between a file and memory, enabling you to read, write, or perform other operations on the file through the memory pointer specified by `to`.",
  "__errno_location": "**Purpose:**\n\nThe `__errno_location` function provides a mechanism for obtaining the address of the current error location. It is used internally by the compiler and other compiler-related functions.\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nImagine a program that is running smoothly, but it encounters an error. When an error occurs, the program needs to know where it went wrong to fix it. By using `__errno_location`, the compiler can store the address of the error location in a variable called `errno`. This allows the program to access the error location later when it is fixed.\n\n**Everyday analogy:**\n\nThink of `__errno_location` as a GPS device that tells you where you are located on a map. When you get lost or have an accident, the GPS device tells you your location so you can find your way back.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n```c\n__errno_location\nvoid\nerrno\n```",
  "__isoc99_vfwscanf": "**Purpose of each function:**\n\n- **__isoc99_vfwscanf:** This function is responsible for scanning a format string and converting it into a C-style variable argument list. It's used to parse the format string and determine the types of the variables to be assigned.\n\n- **__vfwscanf_internal:** This is an internal function called by `__isoc99_vfwscanf`. It performs the actual scanning and conversion process.\n\n**Real-world applications:**\n\n- **Scanning financial data:** `__isoc99_vfwscanf` can be used to scan financial data from a file or stream, such as stock prices or transaction records.\n\n- **Parsing text formats:** It can be used to parse text formats, such as those used in spreadsheets or configuration files, and convert them into a usable data structure.\n\n**Everyday concepts:**\n\n- **Format string:** This is a template that specifies the format of a variable, such as \"%.2f\".\n- **Variable argument list:** This is a collection of variables of different types that are passed to a function.\n- **Scanning:** This is the process of iterating over a format string and extracting the values of variables according to their positions.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n- `__isoc99_vfwscanf`\n- `__vfwscanf_internal`\n- `FILE *stream`\n- `const wchar_t *format`\n- `va_list args`",
  "__isnan": "**Purpose:**\n\nThe `_isnan` function checks if a value is `NaN` (Not a Number).\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nImagine you have a spreadsheet with a column of financial data. Some of the values in that column might be `NaN` because they are missing or invalid entries.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `_isnan` function uses a bitwise AND (`&`) operation to check the value's class. If the result is `0`, it means the value is `NaN`.\n\n**Everyday analogy:**\n\nThink of `_isnan` as a detective checking a crime scene. If they find a body but it's covered, it might be `NaN` because the body is hidden.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n```python\n# _isnan function\n# Checks if a value is NaN\n```",
  "__fpclassifyf": "**Purpose of each function:**\n\n* `_FCLASS` extracts the class of a floating-point number.\n* `_FCLASS_NORM` checks if the number is in normal (floating-point) format.\n* `_FCLASS_ZERO` checks if the number is in zero format.\n* `_FCLASS_SUBNORM` checks if the number is in subnormal format.\n* `_FCLASS_INF` checks if the number is in infinite format.\n\n**Real-world applications:**\n\n* Normal numbers are used for calculations, data analysis, and machine learning.\n* Zero numbers represent quantities at or below the resolution of the measurement.\n* Subnormal numbers represent numbers that are less than zero but not exactly zero.\n* Infinite numbers represent numbers that are greater than zero but less than infinity.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n```python\n# Function to extract the class of a floating-point number\n_FCLASS\n\n# Flag for normal format\n_FCLASS_NORM\n\n# Flag for zero format\n_FCLASS_ZERO\n\n# Flag for subnormal format\n_FCLASS_SUBNORM\n\n# Flag for infinite format\n_FCLASS_INF\n```",
  "epoll_pwait": "**Purpose:**\n\nThe `epoll_pwait` function waits for events on a specified file descriptor (epfd) using the Epoll API. It blocks the calling thread until an event occurs.\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nImagine a chat application where you're waiting for new messages from a server. The `epoll_pwait` function would allow you to check for incoming messages without having to constantly poll the server.\n\n**Everyday concept:**\n\nThink of `epoll_pwait` as a waiter who watches a specific table for any customers who arrive. When a customer enters the table, the waiter adds them to a queue. The function wakes up the waiter periodically (timeout) and checks if any customers are waiting. If a customer is found, the waiter adds them to the queue and continues watching.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n- `epoll_pwait`\n- `epoll_event`\n- `SIGALRM`\n- `SIGIO`\n- `SIGEVT`",
  "perror": "**Purpose of each function:**\n\n- `perror` - Prints an error message associated with the specified stream.\n- `__fileno` - Returns the file descriptor for the standard output stream.\n- `__dup` - Creates a copy of the file descriptor for the standard output stream.\n- `__glibc_unlikely` - Checks if the file descriptor is valid.\n- `__close` - Closes the file descriptor.\n- `perror_internal` - Prints an error message associated with the specified stream using `perror` internally.\n- `fopen` - Opens a file descriptor for writing.\n- `fclose` - Closes a file descriptor.\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nThe code snippet shows how to handle errors when writing to the standard output stream (`stderr`). If `stderr` is not opened or a problem occurs while writing, `perror` is called to print an error message.\n\n**Everyday concept:**\n\nImagine `stderr` as a virtual output device that you can write to. When you write to `stderr`, the code is actually writing to the underlying file descriptor. If `stderr` is not opened or there is a problem writing to it, an error is reported.",
  "catclose": "**Purpose:**\n\nThe `_nl_catd` function manages the opening and handling of files for a specific catalog. It provides functions to check the file status, read and write data, and clean up resources when necessary.\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nImagine a file manager that allows you to open and edit different types of files, like text, images, or videos. The `_nl_catd` function would handle the underlying file operations behind the scenes, ensuring seamless file access and management.\n\n**Everyday concept:**\n\nThe function is similar to a file manager's open() and close() methods. It allows you to open a file and access its contents, and then close it when you're finished.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n- `_nl_catd`\n- File management\n- File status\n- File handling\n- Open()\n- Close()",
  "lsearch": "**Purpose:**\n\nThe `lsearch` function searches for a specified key in a sorted array using a comparison function. It returns the location of the key in the array if it finds it, or `NULL` if it's not found.\n\n**Real-world application:**\n\nImagine you have a large library with millions of books. `lsearch` would help you find a specific book by searching through the library's records.\n\n**Everyday concept:**\n\nThink of `lsearch` as a librarian searching for a book in a library. If the book is found, the librarian returns its location. If not, they add the book to the end of the library's list.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n* `lsearch`\n* `key`\n* `base`\n* `nmemb`\n* `size`\n* `compar`",
  "rename": "**Purpose of each function:**\n\n- `rename`: This function is used when the source and destination file paths are specified using the `old` and `new` parameters, respectively. It calls the `rename` system call with the specified arguments.\n\n- `renameat`: This function is similar to `rename` but supports the `AT_FDCWD` flag, which allows the source and destination paths to be specified using file descriptor constants. It also supports the `AT_FDCWD` flag for cross-platform compatibility.\n\n- `renameat2`: This function is a specialized version of `renameat` that supports the `AT_FDCWD` flag and also allows the third parameter to specify the flags for the destination path.\n\n**Real-world applications:**\n\n- `rename` is used to change the file name of a file, such as when you rename a file from `old_filename.txt` to `new_filename.txt`.\n\n- `renameat` is used when you need to rename files in a cross-platform manner, taking into account different file system conventions.\n\n- `renameat2` is used when you need to rename files with specific flags or permissions, allowing you to control the behavior of the operation.\n\n**Tags:**\n\n- `rename`\n- `renameat`\n- `renameat2`"
